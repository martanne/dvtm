.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
The
.Nm
is a file buffering utility used by the
.Xr dvtm 1
terminal multiplexer to implement its copy mode. It reads the standard input and saves it to a temporary
file, then opens an editor according to the
.Sx "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" .
.Pp
If the invoked editor terminates with a non-zero exit status or
the file modification time remains unchanged,
.Nm
does not output anything.  Otherwise, it outputs the content of the modified temporary
file to stdout.
.Pp
All command line arguments are forwarded verbatim.
.Xr dvtm 1
uses this to adjust the initial view port by passing
.Sy +n ,
meaning the start of line
.Sy n
should be displayed.
.
.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.
.Nm
will try to find the user editor by checking these variables in order:
.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev DVTM_EDITOR

.
.It Ev VISUAL , Ev EDITOR

.Ev VISUAL
and
.Ev EDITOR .

.Pp

.Xr vi 1
is used.
.
.
.Sh FILES
.

.Pa /tmp/dvtm-editor.XXXXXX .
.Pp
.Pa /dev/tty
is opened to obtain a controlling tty which is used for the standard input/output
streams of the invoked editor.
.
.Sh NOTES
.

as editor is particularly convenient because
